"""
Defines a callback type that is invoked when there is an update in the count of projects, specifically when projects
are added or removed.

It takes as arguments a tuple containing:
1.  A string indicating the name of the [ProjectsFinder](@yw-nav-class:models_project.ProjectsFinder)
that discovered the updates.
2.  A list of Path objects representing the projects that were added.
3.  A list of Path objects representing the projects that were removed.

It returns an awaitable object that, when awaited, completes with None. This allows for asynchronous processing
