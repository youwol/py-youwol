    The class WebpackDevServerSwitch can alter this behavior for a particular package,

    **Attributes**:

    - **packageName** :class:`str`
    Name of the targeted package.

    - **port** :class:`int`
    Listening port of the dev-server.

    - **notServedResources** :class: `List[str]`
    Paths of resources (or folder of resources) that exists in the CDN database but are not part of
    the webpack dev-server scope. This is typically artifacts included  into the CDN database during the publication
    step (which may not exist in the project's working directory).
